The easiest way to use this tracker, you can just use the local save option.
Therefore just insert some part of your name in the "Name" input, for example when your games are named "Hugogame1", "Hugogame2" and so on, you can just enter "Hugo", and all games with a name containing "Hugo" will be tracked. 
It is not case sensitive, so no matter if you write Hugo, HUGO, hugo  or hUGo.
In the "Tracker" input, just insert the id part of the web tracker, so if your tracker page would be https://archipelago.gg/tracker/luJDNo9dNsu3OsIEMSa, you would have to enter "luJDNo9dNsu3OsIEMSa"

After pressing the "" button, the site is automatically scanned and compares the items to the ones you already had last time. On local save, the current items are saved in a txt file where the executable lies.
Also the tracker is saving your "Name" and "Tracker" input into an APTracking.config file on the same location.

There is also support for FTP or mysql storing the data, so it is not important from what place you run, if you always connect to the same ftp or mysql db.
However, a workaround could also be to put the executable on a shared space like onedrive. so it is also automatically synched when using the same account.
